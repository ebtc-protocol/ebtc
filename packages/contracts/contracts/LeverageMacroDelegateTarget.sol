 * @title Implementation of the LeverageMacro, meant to be called via a delegatecall by a SC Like Wallet
 * @notice The Caller MUST implement the `function owner() external view returns (address)`
 * @notice to use this contract:
 *      Add this logic address to `callbackHandler` for the function `onFlashLoan`
 *      Add the inteded allowances (see above)
 *      Toggle the `callbackEnabledForCall` for the current call, by adding a call to `enableCallbackForCall`
 *      Perform the operation
 * @notice NOTE: that tokens will remain in the SC Wallet
 *  You can perform a delegatecall to `sweepToCaller` after the operation to have the SC Wallet send you back the funds
 * @notice If you didn't get it, this is an advanced contract, please simulate the TX with Tenderly before using this
 * @dev Only one deployment of this reference contract must be performed as users will delegatecall to it
 *  This makes upgrades opt-in
